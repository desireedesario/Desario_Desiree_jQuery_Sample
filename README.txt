A description of jQuery work sample

Desario_Desiree_jQuery_Sample: Animate-	In animate, a div is created to contain an image.-	In CSS, padding, height, width, background-color, and a border was added to make it look like a framed image.-	Four .animate() buttons were created so that when the button is clicked, the div is changed (change background color, move to the right, increase, and disappear). Toggle-	Toggle contains a div three images that float left (are side-by-side). Each picture has a button below it. -	Button 1 hides/shows (toggle) one image. Button 2 hides/shows (toggle) two images. Button 3 hides/shows (toggle) all three images.-	Toggle was used creating a function that toggle an image when an ID is identified. Hover -	Hover contains a section (div) of three images. When your cursor is over an image, a caption will appear in a separate element before the image. -	When the user moves their cursor from the image, the caption will disappear.-	I used a function that toggles each caption when hovered. This makes the code look cleaner. Animate Subhead-	A div was created and given a background-color, height/width of 150px and some text for a “subhead”-	When you hover over the title, the subhead will “animate out”, or move the div to and left and increase the font size to 37px. -	This is done with a basic jQuery function. Adding Info-	I have made a size h1 headline, and added three paragraphs below with a button next to them. -	When each button is clicked, that text from the given paragraph tag is captured in a variable and then added to the headline tag.-	This is created with the pAddition function. Input Field-	I have created a form text input field, and have asked for user to input their name. -	When the button is clicked, the content of the field from the user is captures in a variable, and then printed out in another div. -	Styled for fun (padding, color) in CSSPhoto Gallery-	I have created a photo gallery of three photos from the eSports NA 2016 tournament. -	I have added an attribute to the image called “data-photo” that holds the name of the photo. -	In JavaScript, the value of data-photo is captured and used to place a larger version of the photo in a separate div. A Mini Calculator -	I have created two form text fields. -	The viewer is asked to input two numbers, one in each field. -	The button says add, and once it is clicked, the two variables will be added.-	The output of the results is going to be placed in a separate div below.
